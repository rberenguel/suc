This is 50% Gemini and 50% me:

- The fireworks effect is reused from a previous firework effect I had, half written by me and half by Gemini. I used it on answers to Anki cards.
- I had to figure out which divs to observe and how to observe them properly, even after changing labels… That's kind of tricky and likely brittle.

## Problems

- There is not a lot of debouncing and some events could trigger more than once.
- I would really like to extend this to "juice up" other boring interactions, but it seems extremely hard to generalise.

## Why?
